# Travello – OpenAI + Python Travel Application
--------------------------------------
# This project, named Travello, is a travel application developed using OpenAI and Python with Streamlit as part of my bootcamp project. 
It is specifically designed for travelers visiting Dubai, offering personalized travel recommendations and streamlined trip planning. 
Travello app leverages AI to answer all user inquiries related to their trip in Dubai, including local transportation, cultural guidelines, shopping destinations, and more. 
It also includes language translation and local travel tips, making it easier for tourists to navigate the city. 
Using Streamlit allowed me to create an interactive and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall user experience. 
Working on this project helped me deepen my understanding of Python, AI integration, and Streamlit, and I feel confident about the skills I’ve gained. 
This experience has enhanced my ability to build intelligent applications and has motivated me to explore more advanced AI solutions.

# Process I Followed to Complete the Project:
1. Planned the app's features and user experience.
2. Developed the application using Python, OpenAI, and Streamlit.
3. Integrated AI for personalized travel recommendations and user inquiries.
4. Tested and refined the app for a seamless user experience.

# steps
1. Create OpenAI API account
2. Copy API_Key to secure file
3. Create .env - environment variable
4. Store API key.
5. Refer Open AI Doc and implement


## implementation plan
1. Display messages
2. display textbox for input
3. Once user input enter message, pass to OpenAI
4. Store response into messages list and display in screen.
